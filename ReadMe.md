### Problem

Accessibility to healthcare has never been easier than it is today, yet we still find it difficult and challenging to find out time to visit our doctors or clinic for periodic checkup. What if there is a way to schedule a meeting with a doctor at any hour of your choice?


## Solution

- Making accessibility to healthcare even easier. One can book a physician for any time of the day.
- Access to uncommon drugs which can be ordered and shipped to users from any part of the world
- 

## Methodology

This project was built using Next.js app router which communicates with a smart contract backed deployed on the Celo network. 
A Trpc server with prisma orm and a postgres database is used to store more information off chain in order to reduce gas fees. The primary use case of the smart contract is to process payment.


## Challenges faced

Trying to breakdown the project into smaller and digestible chunks which made it easier for me to be able to work
