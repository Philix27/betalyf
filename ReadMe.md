## Problem

- Limited Access to Healthcare: Many individuals struggle to access healthcare services due to geographical barriers or a lack of nearby medical facilities.

- Time Constraints: Busy schedules and long wait times at clinics prevent people from getting timely medical consultations and care.

- Management of Chronic Conditions: Patients with chronic conditions such as hypertension and diabetes often lack the tools and consistent support needed to effectively manage their health.

- Availability of Medical Products: Obtaining essential medical products and supplements can be challenging, especially in remote or underserved areas.

- High Costs: Healthcare services and medical products are often expensive, creating financial barriers for many people in need of care.

- Lack of Personalized Care: Traditional healthcare systems may not always provide personalized care and recommendations tailored to individual health needs.

- Inconvenience of In-Person Visits: The necessity of in-person visits for consultations and prescriptions can be inconvenient and sometimes impossible for those with mobility issues or busy lives.

- Fragmented Healthcare Experience: Managing health can feel disjointed when services and products are spread across multiple providers and locations, leading to inefficiencies and gaps in care.

## Solution

- Making accessibility to healthcare even easier. One can book a physician for any time of the day.
- Access to uncommon drugs which can be ordered and shipped to users from any part of the world
- 

## Methodology

This project was built using Next.js app router which communicates with a smart contract backed deployed on the Celo network. 
A Trpc server with prisma orm and a postgres database is used to store more information off chain in order to reduce gas fees. The primary use case of the smart contract is to process payment.




## Roadmap

## Challenges


### Tools & Frameworks used
- Next.js, React, Wagmi, Solidity, Remix, Typescript
- Wagmi, Ethers, Viem, WalletConnect
- Atlaszk, Remix

### Languages

- Typescript, Solidity

## How is it made?

This app was built using Next.js and TailwindCSS on the frontend, TRPC and Prisma on the backend.
Both of which communicates with a deployed Smart contract using Ethers js and Wagmi.

### Technical Solution
<!-- Social connect & Minipay -->
When  a user register's the email and wallet address is also registered using social connect 
where the email is mapped to their wallet address. Once registered the user can book 
a physician for consultation or buy any drugs from the pharmacy store. All payments can be made
using Minipay - Opera mini
